# Zero Trust

Nais embraces the [zero trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) security model, where the core principle is to "never trust, always verify".

In Nais, every [workload](../README.md) is isolated by default.
Workloads are not able to make _any_ outbound requests or receive _any_ incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed.

We use _access policies_ to specify which applications and external addresses a workload can communicate with.
This is done by defining _inbound_ and _outbound_ policies in the workload's manifest.

## Inbound traffic

Allowing inbound access to your application depends on your consumers and the [environment](../explanations/environment.md) they're in:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Are your consumers in the same environment?]
  A --> |Yes| B[Are they in the same namespace?]
  A --> |No| Ingress[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../application/how-to/expose'>Expose through ingress</a>]
  B --> |Yes| InternalSameNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#receive-requests-from-workloads-in-the-same-namespace'>Allow access in same namespace</a>]
  B --> |No| InternalOtherNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#receive-requests-from-workloads-in-other-namespaces'>Allow access from other namespaces</a>]
```

### Service discovery

Consumers running in the same environment should prefer to communicate with your workload via [service discovery](../application/explanations/expose.md#service-discovery).

[`.spec.accessPolicy.inbound`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyinbound) controls inbound network traffic via service discovery.

### Ingress

To allow consumers in other environments to communicate with your workload, you should expose it with an [ingress](../application/explanations/expose.md#ingress).
The ingress domain controls which networks the ingress is reachable from. Other than that, inbound network traffic through an ingress is essentially unrestricted.

[`.spec.accessPolicy.inbound`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyinbound) **does not** control network traffic via ingresses.

## Outbound traffic

Allowing outbound traffic from your application depends on whether you're using [service discovery](../application/explanations/expose.md#service-discovery) or external addresses:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Is the service you want to call in the same environment?]
  A --> |Yes| B[Are they in the same namespace?]
  A --> |No| Internet[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-external-addresses'>Allow access to external address</a>]
  B --> |Yes| InternalSameNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-another-app-in-the-same-namespace'>Allow access to same namespace</a>]
  B --> |No| InternalOtherNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-other-app-in-another-namespace'>Allow access to other namespaces</a>]
```

Services offered by Nais (such as [databases](../../persistence/postgres/README.md)) are automatically configured with necessary outbound access policies.

### Service discovery

If the service you want to call is in the same environment, you should communicate with it by using service discovery.

[`.spec.accessPolicy.outbound.rules`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyoutboundrules) controls outbound network traffic via service discovery.

### External addresses

An external address is any address outside the environment your workload is running in.
[Ingresses](../application/explanations/expose.md#ingress) exposed by other workloads are also considered external addresses.

[`.spec.accessPolicy.outbound.external`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyoutboundexternal) controls which external addresses your workload can communicate with.

## Example

Consider two applications: a frontend and a backend.
The frontend needs to communicate with the backend by using service discovery.

This communication is denied by default as indicated by the red arrow.
![access-policy-1](../../assets/access-policy-1.png)

To fix this, the frontend needs to allow outbound traffic to the backend by adding the following access policy:

```yaml
spec:
  accessPolicy:
    outbound:
      rules:
        - application: backend
```

![access-policy-2](../../assets/access-policy-2.png)

However, the frontend is still not allowed to make any requests to the backend.
The missing piece of the puzzle is an inbound policy, allowing the frontend to communicate with it:

```yaml
spec:
  accessPolicy:
    inbound:
      rules:
        - application: frontend
```

![access-policy-3](../../assets/access-policy-3.png)

Now that both applications have explicitly declared their respective inbound and outbound policies, communication is allowed.
